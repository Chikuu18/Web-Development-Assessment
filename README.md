**Web Development Assessment - Landing Page with API Integration**

This assessment evaluates your skills in designing and developing a basic landing page with API integration. You will create a front-end using React and a back-end using either Spring or Go, fetching data from an API and displaying it on the landing page.

Objective:

Design and implement a visually appealing and responsive landing page.
Integrate with a provided API to fetch post data.
Parse and display relevant post information on the landing page.
Utilize appropriate technologies (React for front-end, Spring or Go for back-end).
Scenario:

Imagine you are building a landing page for a fictional company called "TechBuzz." This page should showcase trending tech articles and entice users to explore the company's blog or services.

Requirements:

Front-End (React):
Design a visually appealing and responsive landing page using React.
Implement components for displaying post titles, excerpts, and links.
Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
Back-End (Spring or Go):
Choose either Spring or Go as your back-end technology.
Develop a simple API endpoint to fetch a list of post data from a provided API URL (URL will be provided).
Parse the fetched data and extract relevant information (title, excerpt, link).
Expose the extracted data through an API endpoint for consumption by the front-end.
Data Integration:
Create an API call from the React front-end to the back-end API endpoint.
Display the retrieved post data on the landing page using appropriate components.
Bonus:
Implement pagination to load more posts on demand.
Incorporate search functionality to filter posts by keywords.
Add animations or interactive elements to enhance the user experience.
Evaluation Criteria:

Design: Visual appeal, responsiveness, and adherence to best practices.
Front-End Development: Code quality, use of React components, and efficient data handling.
